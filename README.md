# Final-Project
# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description
This project is a data analysis notebook that tracks global COVID-19 trends including confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations. It uses real-world datasets, cleans and processes the data, explores time-based and regional trends, and visualizes insights using Python libraries. The final product presents a structured report suitable for presentation.

## Objectives
- Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- Analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare metrics across countries and regions
- Visualize trends using charts
- Summarize findings in a clear, narrative format

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to Run the Project
1. Download the dataset from:
   - [Our World in Data CSV](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-data)
2. Open the Colab notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
3. Upload the dataset (`owid-covid-data.csv`) using the Colab file upload tool.
4. Run all cells from top to bottom.
5. Explore the outputs and visualizations.
6. (Optional) Go to `File > Print > Save as PDF` to export the report.

## Data Sources
- [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-data)
- [Johns Hopkins University CSSE GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

## Insights and Reflections
- Time-series plots reveal different waves of infections per country.
- Vaccination rollouts vary significantly across regions.
- Some countries with high case counts had relatively low death rates.
- Cleaning real-world data is crucial and often time-consuming.
